      <description>🚨🌟 Grayscale has indicated that the current volume of tokenized assets (RWA) is minimal, making up about 0.01% of the global stock and bond markets. However, by 2030, this volume is projected to grow by nearly 1000 times as advancements in blockchain infrastructure and regulations take shape. Tokenization is being recognized as the future, with significant implications for sectors like real estate, stocks, bonds, and more, as highlighted by the CEOs of Coinbase and BlackRock.

      <description>🔍 There are growing concerns regarding U.S. stocks, cryptocurrency, and the impact of Trump's presidency. His policies have driven the SP500 to new heights and relaxed regulations on crypto, leading to an increase in market capitalization. However, his exit from office could potentially lead to a stock market correction, as he won't be focused on sustaining record SP500 levels. The incoming U.S. administration may introduce changes to crypto regulations that could be less supportive. MT in MAX</description>
