      <description>🇷🇺 SberCIB's baseline projection for 2026 indicates that the ruble is expected to depreciate further, hitting 14.7 RUB per yuan and 100 RUB per dollar. This outlook is influenced by several factors, including a decrease in the key interest rate, anticipated reductions in foreign currency sales by the Central Bank, and a possible decline in currency sales by exporters resulting from low oil prices.</description>

      <description>⚠️ In a dramatic turn of events, Netflix's stock fell to a seven-month low following its announcement of acquiring Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, amounting to $82.7 billion. In response, CNBC revealed that Paramount is considering a $30 per share offer for Warner Bros., potentially circumventing Netflix by appealing directly to shareholders. There are reports that the White House is doubtful about the deal, which could lead to increased pressure on antitrust regulators to support Paramount, whose CEO has connections to Trump. If the acquisition is blocked, Netflix could face a hefty $5.8 billion penalty to Warner Bros.</description>
