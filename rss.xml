      <description>❗️✴️ Experts from IOSG Ventures believe that the revival of large-scale altcoin seasons, reminiscent of previous ones, is improbable due to the recent boom in new token launches. This influx has led to fragmented liquidity and divided investor focus, with institutions primarily concentrating on BTC and ETH. Analysts emphasize that pinpointing high-quality tokens for potential returns is essential, as widespread growth is no longer a viable expectation. MT in MAX</description>

      <description>🚨🌟 Grayscale has indicated that the current volume of tokenized assets (RWA) is minimal, making up about 0.01% of the global stock and bond markets. However, by 2030, this volume is projected to grow by nearly 1000 times as advancements in blockchain infrastructure and regulations take shape. Tokenization is being recognized as the future, with significant implications for sectors like real estate, stocks, bonds, and more, as highlighted by the CEOs of Coinbase and BlackRock.
