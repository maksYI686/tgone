      <description>🇺🇸 The behavior of U.S. stocks during Trump's presidency mirrors trends from his initial term. After chaotic tariff declarations, a phase of stability—dubbed "Trump equilibrium"—emerges. Trump often highlights stock market milestones, showing his focus on the S&amp;P 500. He has promised to keep stock values elevated. Given that U.S. households have significant investments, any letdown could influence voter sentiment as the midterm elections approach.

      <description>❗️✴️ Experts from IOSG Ventures believe that the revival of large-scale altcoin seasons, reminiscent of previous ones, is improbable due to the recent boom in new token launches. This influx has led to fragmented liquidity and divided investor focus, with institutions primarily concentrating on BTC and ETH. Analysts emphasize that pinpointing high-quality tokens for potential returns is essential, as widespread growth is no longer a viable expectation. MT in MAX</description>

      <description>🔍 There are growing concerns regarding U.S. stocks, cryptocurrency, and the impact of Trump's presidency. His policies have driven the SP500 to new heights and relaxed regulations on crypto, leading to an increase in market capitalization. However, his exit from office could potentially lead to a stock market correction, as he won't be focused on sustaining record SP500 levels. The incoming U.S. administration may introduce changes to crypto regulations that could be less supportive. MT in MAX</description>
