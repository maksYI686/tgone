      <description>🔗 EU member states were unable to come to a consensus on seizing Russian assets during the initial day of discussions, primarily due to Belgium's requests. Negotiations will carry on. The EU summit has directed the Commission to develop a "reparation credit" for Kyiv utilizing Russian assets. In addition, the EU has agreed to extend a €90 billion interest-free loan to Ukraine for the years 2026-2027. Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia have chosen to withdraw from the funding initiative. Ursula von der Leyen proposed that a qualified majority vote could potentially allow for the unfreezing of sovereign Russian assets.</description>
