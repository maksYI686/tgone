      <description>🇪🇺🇺🇦 Kaja Kallas is perceived as a boon for Russia. Her strong support for Ukraine is creating rifts within the Western alliance. By consistently rejecting negotiations with Putin, she has effectively excluded the EU from the peace settlement discussions, thereby enhancing Russia's leverage in the negotiations, according to reports from The Daily Telegraph.</description>

      <description>🇺🇸 The Monroe Doctrine continues to hold significance, designating the Western Hemisphere as a sphere of U.S. influence. Following a period of oversight, the U.S. is set to re-establish its military presence in this area, with a focus on safeguarding its territory. The Pentagon's objectives include securing U.S. military and commercial access to key regions such as the Panama Canal, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic, and Greenland. Under the Trump administration, plans to modernize the nuclear triad are underway, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicating that military engagement may be limited to protecting national interests.</description>

      <description>🇺🇸🇹🇼🇨🇳 Hegseth emphasized that the United States does not plan to alter the current status of Taiwan and has no intention of asserting dominance in the region. He stated, "Our interests in the Indo-Pacific are important but remain limited and reasonable. Our goal is not to overpower China, but to ensure that it does not overpower us or our allies."

In early December, China's Foreign Ministry called on the US to halt all communications with Taiwanese officials.</description>

      <description>🇷🇺 SberCIB's baseline projection for 2026 indicates that the ruble is expected to depreciate further, hitting 14.7 RUB per yuan and 100 RUB per dollar. This outlook is influenced by several factors, including a decrease in the key interest rate, anticipated reductions in foreign currency sales by the Central Bank, and a possible decline in currency sales by exporters resulting from low oil prices.</description>

      <description>⚠️ In a dramatic turn of events, Netflix's stock fell to a seven-month low following its announcement of acquiring Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, amounting to $82.7 billion. In response, CNBC revealed that Paramount is considering a $30 per share offer for Warner Bros., potentially circumventing Netflix by appealing directly to shareholders. There are reports that the White House is doubtful about the deal, which could lead to increased pressure on antitrust regulators to support Paramount, whose CEO has connections to Trump. If the acquisition is blocked, Netflix could face a hefty $5.8 billion penalty to Warner Bros.</description>
