      <description>⚠️🇺🇦 Geopolitical analysts indicate that Zelensky and European leaders are strategically positioning themselves to endure until the conclusion of Trump's presidency. They anticipate that negotiations with the U.S. could take time, believing there is a possibility to bring an end to the conflict. European nations perceive Trump as a "lame duck" and are biding their time for his departure. Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to supply arms to Ukraine and European allies through NATO. As we approach 2026, the implications of the U.S. elections and the direction of MAGA Republicans will become increasingly significant. The situation is fluid. source</description>
