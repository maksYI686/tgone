      <description>⚠️ Zelensky is looking to modify Trump's peace plan to make it more acceptable for Ukraine without explicitly rejecting it, according to the WSJ. He noted that the U.S. has not yet responded to Ukraine's latest proposals. Ushakov mentioned that Russia has not reviewed the proposals from the EU and Ukraine. Zelensky highlighted that the plan will require compromises. The Kremlin has criticized NATO Secretary-General Rutte. Meanwhile, Zelensky is also preparing for potential elections. The Kremlin is insisting on guarantees if any peace agreements are reached. Zelensky stated that if negotiations fail, alternative solutions must be explored.</description>
